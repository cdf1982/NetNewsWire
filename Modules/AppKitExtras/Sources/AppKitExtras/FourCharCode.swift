	///	4-byte values commonly represented as values like `'odoc'` where each byte is
	///	represented as its ASCII character. This property turns a Swift string into
	///	its `FourCharCode` equivalent, as Swift doesn't recognize `FourCharCode` types
	///	natively just yet. With this extension, one can use `"odoc".fourCharCode`
	///	where one would really want to use `'odoc'`.
